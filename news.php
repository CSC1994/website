<H3>Pencil Code moves from Google Code to Github</H3>
As you may have seen, in March 2015, Google announced that it will be closing down Google Code in January 15, 2016. As a consequence, we'll now be moving to github. The email below only went to the people who have contributed to the Pencil Code. If any of you have any code developments not yet checked in, please <a href="contact.php">contact us</a>.<br>
If everything goes according to plan, several hours after Saturday April 18 at 19:00 Stockholm time (17:00 GMT), you should be able to check out the code under github, either with git or with svn:<br>
<div class="codescroll"><code>svn checkout https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/trunk/ pencil-code</code></div>
Please <a href="http://pencil-code.nordita.org/UserMeetings/2015/email_github.txt">find here more details</a>.
</li>
