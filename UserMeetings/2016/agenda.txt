- state of the conductivity module?

- state of the particle modules (documentation, avoiding overlap, etc)
  Dhruba to report

- re-organization of the particle modules with "swarms" being a sub-module?
  Dhruba to report

- general re-initialization of particles
  inject particles during the run.
  Axel

- PC paper - now for real?
  Axel to report

- hightlights to update on the webpage
  Axel to report

- IDL auto tests, status report & workplan
  what is actually tested and when/where is this test actually run?

- Yin-yang mesh, status report (Matthias)

- F2003, status report, Matthias & Philippe

- Boundary conditions, Matthias

- cuda, GPU, status report

- Parallel IO with HDF5
  introduction from Philippe
  HDF5 as new "portable" file format

- github status: recent increase in response time

- messy initial conditions folder 
  (WL: I disagree that the initial condition folder is messy, 
       unless it is said that the special folder is messy too)
   AB: yes both are messy; for the time being a proper README file would help

- better documentation of the alternatives to IDL (Python and Julia)
  (WL: I've been telling newcomers to avoid IDL and use python instead but 
       there's no proper documentation, either in the manual or the subroutines themselves.)
  (Philippe: Julia is the better choice over Python and IDL. If you need
       some Python/IDL modules, you may remote-control them from Julia.)

- Combining special modules;

- The code is getting too multipurpose, is it a good thing? Colin described it as "walking into someone's attic". 
  Pencil is an engine and a toolbox, and right now they're amalgamated together. Ideally we should separate them: 
  a clean engine and an extended toolbox. The engine should be magnetic.f90 with the induction equation and little
  else, and all the "battery term", "lambda term" and other user-specific things should go in specials. 

- future PC user meetings: Newcastle, Boulder, elsewhere...?
