- Code the conductivity module
  what was the problem? Not working??

- non-uniform grid: upwinding, boundary conditions
  many relevant b.c.s do not comply, because not symmetric about mirror.
  not using mapping function is implemented, but leads to instability.
  deriv_alt, but is not currently being used.
  Reason for instability to be investigated.

- PC paper:
  accounce on pencil-code-discuss and all users (commit list): May 2015
  Phys. Scripta, deadline: Friday, 20 May 2016, interest deadline Sept 17.
  Aarnes: Immersed boundary condition
  Krueger: Solid Chemistry and combustion
  Sarson: Interstellar physics and cosmic rays
  Schreiber & Baehr: Planet formation
  Boudin: Coronal response to photospheric driving
  Low plasma-beta MHD (coronal physics)
  Condensation and coagulation, aerosols
  Bourdin: Parallel I/O: technical description and tests
  GPU computations (timings, rolling cache, etc)
  
- Hmax issue: was an error

- volume rendering using radiative transfer module
  related efforts with: paraview, yt, vapor

- python code for reading var files for dust module output.
  is now working, but is a workaround and can be improved (Andreas, Jonas).
  new routines exist for reading particles (Jonas)

- idl test cases
  is probably ok, and was never wrong yet.

- Philippe: short introduction Re: FATAL ERROR: read_snap_double: I/O error
  see his Monday talk. Related to F2003, see below.

- F2003, status report, Matthias & Philipe
  need changes in Makefile (seems outdated!?)
  Matthias is checking in as we speak.

- pc_configtest to be discussed by Philippe
  its fine and highly recommended, just say
  pc_configtest

- cuda, GPU, etc

- future User Meetings: Graz, Newcastle, Boulder
