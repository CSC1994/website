Dear all,
As you will have seen from the news and the pencil-code discussion,
google code will close down and we will have to *move* our repository.

1. Deadline: Saturday April 11 at 19:00 Stockholm time (17:00 GMT).
2. Make sure everything important is checked in (including the www branch)!
3. About 2-3 hours later, the github repository will hopefully be active,
   and we will send an email out when we is done.

Tobias Heinemann <tobias.heinemann@gmail.com> has been doing all the
work for this transition and things look like they are working fine.
You should remove youre old checkout (or move it out of sight) and check
out the new repository. The checkout method with git is:

  git clone https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code.git
  git clone https://github.com/tobson/pencil-code.git

For basic operations, you can continue to use subversion. Remove your old
checkout (or move it out of sight) and checkout the new repository:

  svn checkout https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/trunk/ pencil-code
  svn checkout https://github.com/tobson/pencil-code/trunk/ pencil-code

That's the urgent part. Below the less urgent part.
Axel

4. You can only check in if you have a github accout. Please see:

  https://code.google.com/p/pencil-code/wiki/MappingSubversionToGitUsers

In that case, you can give your github name when checkin out, e.g.,

  svn checkout https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/trunk/ pencil-code --username AxelBrandenburg

5. If you later find that you have uncommitted changes lying around
under google code (e.g. on another machine), you may be able to use the
'svn switch' command to continue using your original svn checkout:

  svn switch https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/trunk/

[This is untested so far]
