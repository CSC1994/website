Dear all,
As you will have seen from the news and the pencil-code discussion,
google code will close down and we will have to *move* our repository.

1. Deadline: Friday April 10 at 21:00 Stockholm time.
2. Make sure everything important is checked in (including the www branch)!
3. By Saturday, April 11, the github repository will hopefully be active.

Tobias Heinemann <tobias.heinemann@gmail.com> has been doing all the
work for this transition and things look like they are working fine.
You can in principle continue with subversion, so then remove you old
checkout (or move it out of sight) and checkout the new repository.
Anonymous check-out:

  svn checkout https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/trunk/ pencil-code

The checkout method with git is:

  XXX

That's the important part. Details follow below.
Axel


** Details **

An import advantage of github (as opposed to google code and sourceforge)
is that there are no embargo countries.

You can only check in if you have a github accout. Please see:

  https://code.google.com/p/pencil-code/wiki/MappingSubversionToGitUsers

In tht case, you can give your github name when checkin out, e.g.,

  svn checkout https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/trunk/ pencil-code --username AxelBrandenburg
