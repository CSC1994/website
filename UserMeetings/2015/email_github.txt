Dear all,
As you will have seen from the news and the pencil-code discussion,
google code will close down and we will have to *move* our repository.

1. Deadline: Friday April 10 at 21:00 Stockholm time (19:00 GMT).
2. Make sure everything important is checked in (including the www branch)!
3. By Saturday, April 11, the github repository will hopefully be active.

Tobias Heinemann <tobias.heinemann@gmail.com> has been doing all the
work for this transition and things look like they are working fine.
You should remove youre old checkout (or move it out of sight) and check
out the new repository.

The checkout method with git is:

  git clone https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code.git


For basic operations, you can continue to use subversion. Remove youre old
checkout (or move it out of sight) and checkout the new repository:

  svn checkout https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/trunk/ pencil-code

If you later find that you have uncommitted changes lying around, you may
be able to use the 'svn switch' command to continue using your original
svn checkout:

  svn switch https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/trunk/

[This is untested so far]


That's the important part. Details follow below.
Axel


** Details **

An import advantage of github (as opposed to google code and sourceforge)
is that there are no embargo countries.

You can only check in if you have a github accout. Please see:

  https://code.google.com/p/pencil-code/wiki/MappingSubversionToGitUsers

In that case, you can give your github name when checkin out, e.g.,

  svn checkout https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/trunk/ pencil-code --username AxelBrandenburg
