Dear all,

As you will have seen from the news and the pencil-code discussion,
google code will close down and we will have to *move* our repository.

Tobias Heinemann <tobias.heinemann@gmail.com> has been doing all the
work for this transition and things look like they are working fine.

You will only be able to use github if you have a github account.
Following our email of yesterday, many of you have already 
registered at https://github.com/ .
Many of you have already updated ${PENCIL_HOME}/license/authors.txt.
This must be completed before the transition deadline (see below).

For those who want to experiment with github, we have a test repository
under https://github.com/pencil-code/test.git . The final location will be
 https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code.git


Deadline
========

1. Saturday April 11 at 19:00 Stockholm time (17:00 GMT) is the deadline
   for commits to googlecode. Commits that happen after that point in
   time, can hopefully be imported to a separate branch in the github
   repository, but you will have to merge them yourself.
2. Thus, it is highly recommended that everything important is checked in
   (including the www branch)!
3. About 2-3 hours later, the github repository will hopefully be active,
   and we will send an email out when we are done.


What to do with your existing checkouts
=======================================

You ought to be able to use the SVN front end to github. So depending on
whether you want to stick with SVN (for some time) or make the jump into
git, you have two options:

A. Continue using SVN 
---------------------

For basic operations, you can continue to use subversion. After April 11, use

  svn switch https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/trunk --username MY_GITHUB_USERNAME

to switch an existing checkout to the new repository.

Alternatively, you can delete (or move out of the way) your existing
checkout(s) and check out afresh:

After April 11, use
  svn checkout https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/trunk/ pencil-code --username MY_GITHUB_USERNAME

[Before April 11, you can *experiment* with
  svn checkout https://github.com/pencil-code/test/trunk/ pencil-code --username MY_GITHUB_USERNAME
]


B. Start using git
------------------

Remove (or move out of the way) your existing
checkout(s) and do

After April 11, use
  git clone https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code.git
[Before April 11, you can experiment with
  git clone https://github.com/pencil-code/test.git
]

Please let us know if there are any urgent issues requiring attention
before the deadline. Other issues will be discussed and resolved at the
Pencil Code User Meeting in Trondheim.

Axel, Toby, and Wolfgang
